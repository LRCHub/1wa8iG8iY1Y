No time to stop, keep on movin'
The whole world is to see
No time to think of things that I am missing
Wherever I go
Black cloud's following me
Each and every town
I'm father's last relation
Doing what I can just to eat
Never 'wanna settle down
I ain't got the patience
Wherever I go
Black cloud's following me
I'm a citizen of no where
The sky's above my head
I wonder where the grass grows
Looking through the sunshine
'Til my judgement day, my judgement day
Wherever I go
Black cloud's following me, yeah
Oh, it's following me around
Don't leave me be
No time to think of the things that I am missing
I've got to keep on moving along, babe
You know I can't settle down, or I'd be dead
Come, come, come here
No time to stop, keep on movin'
'Cause all the world is to see
No time to think
The thing that I am missing
Wherever I go
The black cloud's following me
I'm a citizen of nowhere
The sky's above my head
I wonder where the grass grows
Looking through the sunshine
'Til my judgement day, my judgement day
Wherever I go
Black cloud's following me
You know it's following, following, following me
Never let me go
Keep on moving
We have got to make it
We are going to take it, yeah
